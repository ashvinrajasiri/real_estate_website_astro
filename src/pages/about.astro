        I Got Into Real Estate Because I Lived It
      </h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Five years ago, I was working in a technical role and went through buying my first place in the GTA. The agent showed me properties but never explained why one neighborhood cost $150k more than another, what I could actually negotiate, or how to think about commute versus square footage. I figured it out on my own and thought: someone should actually teach people this stuff.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Now I work mostly with first-time buyers trying to break into the market and families outgrowing their current space. A lot of first-time buyers tell me they feel like they are already behind—watching prices climb while they save for a down payment. Families are trying to time selling and buying without ending up in their parents basement for three months.
      </p>
      <p>
        I walk people through the actual numbers, show them neighborhoods they had not thought about, and never push them to buy before they are ready. My background taught me to solve problems methodically, and that is how I approach real estate—break it down, explain the options, help you make the call that works for your life.
